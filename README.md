This is some code used on a project for my bachelor. 
It was used for parsing various fields from film pages on Filmaffinity and adding it to a database.
It is kind of weird because the html parsing is done in python while the database is managed with php. It had to be done this way because no mysql connector was installed in the server where all this was going to be run. So I decided not to bother the administrator too much because he was the teacher too.

I hope someone finds any of it useful.

Cheers,
Jorge
